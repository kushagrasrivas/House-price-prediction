house price prediction
üè° Boston Housing Price Prediction This project predicts Boston house prices using two machine learning models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. The dataset (BostonHousing.csv) is cleaned by filling missing values with the mean. The code splits data into training and testing sets, scales features, and evaluates both models using mean squared error and R¬≤ score. It also provides useful visualizations like correlation heatmaps, pairplots of important features, and feature importance from the Random Forest. At the end, the script allows the user to input only key features‚Äîsuch as average rooms (RM), percentage lower status population (LSTAT), pupil-teacher ratio (PTRATIO), and property tax rate (TAX)‚Äîto predict house prices using both models. To run, place the dataset in the project folder and execute the script; then enter the requested values when prompted. Required libraries include pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. This project serves as a straightforward example of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions with user input in Python.
